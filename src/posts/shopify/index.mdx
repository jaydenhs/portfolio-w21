# Context

In the winter of 2022, I was a design technologist intern at e-commerce company
Shopify. This case study focuses on my redesign of the on-site search experience
on<AutoLink to="https://shopify.dev/"> shopify.dev</AutoLink>, a documentation
site that empowers third-party developers to build Shopify apps and stores.

This is what the current on-site search experience looked like:

<FullBleed>
  <Image
    src={'shopify/images/current-site.webm'}
    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-11/12 rounded-t-xl"
    caption="The current shopify.dev on-site search experience"
  />
</FullBleed>

Third-party developers found the current search experience **clunky and
irrelevant**.

> Your search functionality is awful. I use Google instead of your built-in
> search bar to search the docs. It needs some tender love and care.
>
> <br />
>
> – a third-party Shopify developer

This led to **only 0.5% of daily users using our on-site search**.

    caption="The percentage of daily users using our on-site search fluctuated around 0.5%"
    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-2/3"
  />
</FullBleed>

# The Problem

<HighlightedSection>

With shopify.dev containing thousands of pages, the **inefficiency of our
on-site search** resulted in third-party developers being unable to find key API
resources quickly. This led to **decreased Shopify app ecosystem productivity**.

</HighlightedSection>

# Understanding the Infrastructure

First, I dove deep into understanding the current technical infrastructure.

Through this, I diagnosed foundational problems with how the backend was
serializing content. **We were giving messy information to our search engine
(ElasticSearch), and had terrible result relevancy as a result.**

<FullBleed>
  <Image
    src="search-serialization.png"
    caption="Useful information presented on our pages was being buried underneath clutter in our search backend"
    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-5/6"
  />
</FullBleed>

This deep-dive also helped me set a shared understanding in my team of how our
search currently works.

# Defining UX Principles

Our design team started defining principles and solutions based on our
assumptions. But we were stopped by our product manager, who **questioned what
evidence these decisions were being based on.**

So we took a step back, and interviewed eight third-party developers. Based on
the frequency and intensity of their feedback, we defined the UX principles of
our search:

<NumberedList
  data={[
    {
      title: 'Design search results for scannability',
      description:
        'Currently, developers had to manually parse through cluttered descriptions and breadcrumbs to determine the best search result. Scannable results help developers quickly determine the best option for their use case.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Filtered search for the win',
      description:
        'For a continuously-expanding information site like shopify.dev, providing developers the ability to narrow a large set of results down is critical.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Personalize the experience',
      description:
        'Developers only cared about the one or two APIs used in their work. By saving their filters, our on-site search experience would be more frictionless.',
    },
  ]}
/>

# Wireframing

Following a competitive analysis and low-fidelity designs, I collaborated with
our senior product designer and content designer to create high-fidelity Figma
wireframes based on our principles:

<FullBleed>
  <Image
    src="search-modal.jpg"
    caption="The high-fidelity search modal mockup our team created"
    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-full"
  />
</FullBleed>

# Prototyping Filtered Search

**I created a prototype in our production codebase with React, Ruby on Rails,
and ElasticSearch.**

<FullBleed>
  <Image
    src="tech-stack.jpg"
    caption="My prototype leveraged the existing tech stack of React, Ruby on Rails, and ElasticSearch"
    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-2/3"
  />
</FullBleed>

I focused on designing the interaction-heavy filtering experiences that couldn't
easily be replicated in Figma, and would benefit the most from being
experimented with in a production environment.

Here's what my prototype looked like:

<FullBleed>
  <FeatureGIFs
    data={[
      {
        src: 'shopify/images/using-tabs.webm',
        title: 'Filter-by-category tabs',
        description:
          "Based on the search query, the search modal would display category-specific tabs. On click, the tabs would display results from that category. A mixture of results would be displayed by default in the 'All' tab.",
      },
      {
        src: 'shopify/images/dynamic-tabs.webm',
        title: 'Dynamic tab positioning',
        description:
          'These tabs would be dynamically ordered from left-to-right based on the relevance of their respective categories.',
      },
      {
        src: 'shopify/images/filter-checkboxes.webm',
        title: 'Personalized filters',
        description:
          'The search modal would also enable developers to view content only from selected categories. This helped developers focus on results for the Shopify APIs of their current project.',
      },
      {
        src: 'shopify/images/filter-cookies.webm',
        title: 'Saving filters',
        description:
          'Even after navigating to away from the page, selected filters were preserved using cookies.',
      },
      {
        src: 'shopify/images/filter-clear-all.webm',
        title: 'Clearing filters',
        description:
          'If a developer wanted to remove their filters, they could clear them in one click.',
      },
    ]}
  />
</FullBleed>

# Defining Edge Cases

Prototyping with code also forced our design team to solve edge cases we hadn't
accounted for.

For example, to limit the length of the 'All (results)' tab, we truncated the
search results displayed in each section. After experimenting with different
algorithms, our design team chose the path that best complimented the
functionality in our designs.

<FullBleed>
  <Image
    src={'shopify/images/es-truncation.webm'}
    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-7/12"
    captionClassName="w-1/2"
    caption="Results below the score threshold (highlighted in red) were retained to preserve 'View all results' functionality"
  />
</FullBleed>

# Implementing for the Keyboard

Another strength of coded prototypes is that it enabled our design team to
design keyboard navigation, a feature required for developers.

Here's what opening, navigating, and selecting in the search modal looked like:

<FullBleed>
  <Image
    src={'shopify/images/keyboard-accessibility.webm'}
    className="mt-3 mb-2 mx-auto w-7/12"
    captionClassName="w-1/2"
    caption="Interactions were linked to / (open search bar), arrow keys (result navigation), Esc (close search bar), and ↩ (open selected result)"
  />
</FullBleed>

# Next Steps

After I handed the prototype off to the lead developer, the team started
building for production.

Since the coded prototype derisks developer handoff, we expect **the new search
experience should be shipped by Fall 2022**.
